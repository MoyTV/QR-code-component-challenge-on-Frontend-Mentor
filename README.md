## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Like almost with every project, you can learn something from trying solutions that make sense in your head, but probably is not as easy as you might initially think.

This is my first solution submit, so this is a huge learning step for me.

### Continued development

I want to continue creating real-life-like projects.
